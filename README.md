# WebGPT Analyzer Chrome Extension

## Overview

The WebGPT Analyzer is a Chrome extension designed to provide insights into the web search activity within your ChatGPT conversations. It extracts and organizes information about the search queries made, the user's messages, and the web sources (URLs) that were both explicitly used and those that were found but not utilized in the conversation.

This extension is particularly useful for understanding how ChatGPT leverages web search in its responses and for reviewing the underlying data sources.

## Features

-   **Comprehensive Search Analysis**: Extracts and categorizes all search queries made by ChatGPT during conversations, with intelligent grouping and organization.
-   **Unified Search Results Display**: All search-related information is organized in a streamlined Web Search section:
    -   **Search Queries**: Complete list of all search queries performed by ChatGPT
    -   **Used Search Results**: Web pages and product recommendations that ChatGPT explicitly referenced in its response, including both web citations and product suggestions with detailed information (price, rating, reviews, merchants)
    -   **Unused Search Results**: Search results that were retrieved but not incorporated into the final response
-   **Product Integration**: Product recommendations now appear seamlessly within the "Used Search Results" section, clearly marked with [Product] prefix and comprehensive details including pricing, ratings, and merchant information.
-   **User Message Display**: Shows the complete conversation context by displaying all user messages sent during the conversation.
-   **Reasoning Analysis**: Extracts and displays ChatGPT's internal reasoning process, including thought summaries and detailed content from its decision-making process.
-   **Smart Data Handling**: Robust extraction logic that handles empty URLs, missing data fields, and various ChatGPT response formats with appropriate fallbacks.
-   **Collapsible Interface**: All sections are expandable/collapsible, allowing users to focus on relevant information and manage display density.
-   **Resilient Design**: Built with fallback CSS selectors and robust data parsing to maintain functionality across ChatGPT interface updates.
-   **Integrated Sidebar UI**: Clean, professional sidebar interface that slides in smoothly without disrupting the ChatGPT conversation experience.

## Technical Details

-   **Manifest V3**: The extension is built using Chrome Extension Manifest V3, adhering to the latest security and performance standards.
-   **Background Script (`background.js`)**: Listens for the extension icon click and injects the `content.js` script into the active ChatGPT conversation tab.
-   **Content Script (`content.js`)**: This is the core of the extension. It performs the following actions:
    -   Dynamically creates and injects the sidebar UI into the ChatGPT page with resilient CSS selectors.
    -   Fetches conversation data from ChatGPT's internal `backend-api` using the user's session `accessToken`.
    -   Uses efficient single-pass parsing to extract data from ChatGPT's conversation JSON structure:
        -   **User Messages**: From `role === 'user'` messages with `content_type === 'text'`
        -   **Search Queries**: From `role === 'tool'` + `author.name === 'web.run'` messages
        -   **Search Results**: From tool message metadata in `search_result_groups`
        -   **Used Results**: From final assistant message `content_references` (both web pages and products)
        -   **Reasoning Data**: From `content_type === 'thoughts'` messages with summary/content pairs
    -   Implements robust data handling with product ID-based deduplication (not URL-based) and fallback values for missing data.
    -   Renders extracted data into an interactive sidebar with accordion-style collapsible sections.
    -   Includes comprehensive error handling for network issues, authentication failures, and malformed data structures.
